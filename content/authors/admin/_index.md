As a research scientist at the Toyota Research Institute, I bring my expertise in machine learning with a doctorate from Paris Saclay University. My current research interests include developing embodied machine learning solutions for sensory-motor systems and exploring the frontiers of robotics with human interactions. Through my work, I am dedicated to advancing state-of-the-art ML research for robotics and driving meaningful innovation.
