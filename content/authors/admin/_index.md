#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I’m a machine learning research scientist at the Toyota Research Institute, where I specialize in transformers, large language models, vision language models, and large behavior models. My passion for ML has led me to explore a variety of fields, including self-driving cars, robotics, and language processing. Whether it's making a language model smarter or teaching robots new tricks, I’m always on the lookout for the next big breakthrough!
