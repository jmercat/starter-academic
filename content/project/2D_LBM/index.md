This project is the continuation of a school project made at [ENSEIRB-MatMeca](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr) in Fortran. I have re-written it in C++ using the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library and added a simple [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) interactive interface.

# [![Video showing the interactive interface.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/s7RWTfwuPZo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7RWTfwuPZo)

# Slides (optional).
#   Associate this project with Markdown slides.
#   Simply enter your slide deck's filename without extension.
#   E.g. `slides = "example-slides"` references `content/slides/example-slides.md`.
#   Otherwise, set `slides = ""`.
