abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is useful for learning behavior from demonstrations, especially for complex tasks. However, the learned policy can only mimic the demonstrated behavior. We propose a new problem setting called policy customization to adapt the policy to different downstream tasks while maintaining its imitative nature. We introduce Residual Q-learning, a framework that customizes the policy by combining inherent rewards from demonstrations and additional rewards from downstream tasks. Our algorithms achieve policy customization effectively in various environments.
